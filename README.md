Powers [JabHunter.com](https://jabhunter.com/) - Going fast...get 'em while they're cold!

Find soon-to-expire and extra Covid-19 vaccine doses before they go to waste. View reports from other jab hunters in your local community about appointment availability and soon-to-expire/extra dose policies for local vaccine providers such as pharmacies, clinics, events, hospitals, etc. For more information see [JabHunter's FAQ](https://jabhunter.com/faq)

The goal of this software is that it could be used to power a similar site in any community. The website pages use Google Docs, the data for the feed is supplied from a Google Sheet and the field reports about vaccine availability in the community is powered by Google Forms.
